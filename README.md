## A Monte Carlo Options Pricing Model

- Shows the total profit of Call and Put Options

- All profits are based on standard contract sizes (100 shares)

- Profits are based on 100,000 simulations

- This project was inspired by *EthernetWink* on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/@ethernetwink7230, however, I have significantly changed the initial struture of the code implement to Average Profit Prediction.
